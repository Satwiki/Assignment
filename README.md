# Assignment
This includes the ongoing work for the assignment given by Devathon. 
As I proceed, I will be committing changes in the files included. 

/* Note: Issues faced */
There are limitations in the API provided. It does not provide all the data as required, e.g., Rent, Reviews etc. In order to show detailed data, there is a link on the page "Click for more info" which will redirect to the main website to fetch more data. 
Could not find the parameter to enter the 'no. of rooms' needed in a hotel. There are only two parameters e.g. number of adults and childrenfor each room. 
Only thumbnail size image is getting fetched from the url, which is not in a proper shape to show. But since there are no other images available, I displayed this one only. 

In case of any issue, please contact me in de.satwiki@gmail.com
